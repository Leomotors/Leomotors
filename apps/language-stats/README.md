# Language-Stats

Get Summary of Your Language Stats

- ```GH_PAT="Your Token" yarn load``` to Load Data from GitHub API

- ```yarn analyze``` to start analysis and save into csv

You can look at example for output csv, I recommend putting it in Excel, convert to xlsx and create table to unlock ability to sort by each language!
